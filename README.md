# FEAST
**FEAST** is a simulation framework focused on the modeling and analysis of spinning systems using finite element methods. Designed for research, development, and exploration in rotor dynamics and turbomachinery, FEAST aims to be modular, extensible, and easy to integrate with modern numerical workflows.
